      Principles that guide my design work.

        <h2 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Clarity over cleverness</h2>
        <p>
          Good design communicates clearly. If users need to think too hard,
          we've failed. Prioritize understanding over aesthetics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Simplicity is hard work</h2>
        <p>
          Simple solutions require more effort than complex ones. Remove features
          until it breaks, then add back what's essential.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Design for the edge cases</h2>
        <p>
          The happy path is easy. Real design work happens when things go wrong,
          when data is missing, when users behave unexpectedly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Systems over pixels</h2>
        <p>
          Individual screens matter less than how they work together. Build systems
          that scale, patterns that repeat, decisions that compound.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Ship and iterate</h2>
        <p>
          Perfect is the enemy of done. Get it in front of users early, learn fast,
          improve continuously. Real feedback beats assumptions.
